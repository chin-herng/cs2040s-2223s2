Archive of solutions for CS2040S AY22/23 Semester 2 problem sets, optional practices and contests. Will be made public only from Coursemology XP freeze to end of the summer break, intended to be used by students to reflect on their own solutions, mainly from the aspect of implementation.

- These are my personal solutions (mostly what I have submitted on Coursemology). These are not the officially suggested solutions.
- Problem statements and some template codes are also included for completeness.
- Short answer/Open-ended questions are not available. My answers for these questions are typically long-winded and overcomplicated. There is not much value reading them.
- The solutions are supposed to pass all public and private test cases when run on Coursemology.
- The solutions will be refined over time (optimising towards pedagogical value). Any feedback/issues regarding the solutions are welcome.

## Credits

Problem statements and template codes are produced by the teaching team of CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms, a course offered in NUS School of Computing. I only wrote the solutions.
